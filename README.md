[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andypetrella/spark-notebook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andypetrella/spark-notebook)

The Spark Notebook is the open source notebook aimed at enterprise environments, providing Data Scientist and Data Engineers with  an interactive web-based editor that can combine Scala code, SQL queries, Markup and JavaScript in a collaborative manner to explore, analyse and learn from massive data sets.

![notebook intro](./docs/images/geo-airports.png)

The Spark Notebook allows performing [reproducible analysis](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/) with Scala, Apache Spark and the Big Data ecosystem.

## Features Highlights

### ![Apache Spark](./docs/images/spark-logo-192x100px.png)

Apache Spark is available out of the box, and is simply accessed by the variable `sparkContext` or `sc`.

#### Multiple Spark Context Support

One of the top most useful feature brought by the Spark Notebook is its separation of the running notebooks.
Each started notebook will spawn a new JVM with its own SparkSession instance. This allows a maximal flexibility for:

* dependencies without clashes
* access different clusters
* tune differently each notebook
* external scheduling (on the roadmap)

#### Metadata-driven configuration

We achieve maximum flexibility with the availability of multiple `sparkContext`s by enabling [metadata driven](./docs/metadata.md) configuration. 

### Scala

The Spark Notebook supports exclusively the Scala programming language, the [The Unpredicted Lingua Franca for Data Science](https://youtu.be/3_oV25nZz8I) and extensibly exploits the JVM ecosystem of libraries to drive an smooth evolution of data-driven software from exploration to production.

The Spark Notebook is available for *NIX and Windows systems in easy to use ZIP/TAR, Docker and DEB packages.

### Reactive

All components in the Spark Notebook are dynamic and reactive. 

The Spark Notebook comes with dynamic charts and most (if not all) components can be listened for and can react to events. This is very helpful in many cases, for example:
* data entering the system live at runtime
* visually plots of events
* multiple interconnected visual components
Dynamic and reactive components mean that you don't have write the html, js, server code just for basic use cases.
