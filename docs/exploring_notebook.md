## Explore the Notebook interface

For this introductory guide, we are, we are going to explore [core/spark-101](http://localhost:9000/notebooks/core/Spark-101.snb)
__(for the links in this page to work, we assume that the Spark Notebook is running on localhost on the default port (9000))__

Click on the folder [core](http://localhost:9000/tree/core) and then click on the [spark-101](http://localhost:9000/notebooks/core/Spark-101.snb) notebook.
